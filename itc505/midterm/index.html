    Addendum
  </h3>
<p>
    <h3>HTML:</h3>
    You have structured your HTML with essential elements like head, header, and body.
    The header contains the title of the game, and the main content is within the story div.
    Choices are dynamically added to the choices div, and there's an image container to display story-related images.</b>
    <h3> CSS:</h3>
    You've applied styles to enhance the visual appeal, such as transitions on hover, background colors, and font styling.
    The styling is responsive and should work well on various screen sizes. </b>
    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
    You've defined an object storyStages to represent different stages of the story, each with text, choices, consequences, and an associated image.
    The startGame function initiates the game by setting the initial stage to "start."
    The updatePage function dynamically updates the HTML content based on the current stage, including text, choices, and images.
    The makeChoice function handles user choices, updating the current stage and calling updatePage.
    The endGame function displays the final stage without choices.</b>
    <h3>Creative Choices and Insights:</h3>
    Your use of objects to represent story stages makes the code modular and easy to maintain. Each stage has its own set of properties, simplifying the structure.
    The decision to use buttons for choices provides a clear and interactive interface for users to navigate the story.
    The inclusion of images enhances the storytelling experience and engages users visually.</b>
    <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
    One potential challenge could be managing a larger story structure with more complex branching paths. However, your current setup seems scalable and organized.
    Ensuring a smooth transition between stages might require additional attention, but your use of functions like updatePage helps maintain code clarity.
